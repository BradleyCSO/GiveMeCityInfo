# Introduction
A front-end which consumes the following https://github.com/BradleyCSO/CityInfo.API Web API. A constraint for this project was that it works with and without JavaScript, where in both cases the user is given responses back from the API. 
With JavaScript it contains improved UX features such as fuzzy-search: giving the user autofill recommendations to find the City they're looking for. Uses CSS w/Sass (with separate, minified stylesheets per page) and Bootstrap for styling.
